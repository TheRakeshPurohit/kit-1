Run the testing-mcp tool

_**Assistant**_

It looks like you want to run the "testing-mcp" tool. However, there isn't a standard tool or script named "testing-mcp" in the provided workspace structure or in the documented commands for this project.

Could you clarify what you mean by "testing-mcp"? For example:
- Is it a script or command you expect to run from the terminal?
- Is it a test file or a specific test suite?
- Is it related to a file or directory in the project (e.g., test-mcp-client.js)?

If you meant to run a specific test or script, please provide the exact filename or path, or clarify your intent so I can assist you accurately!
