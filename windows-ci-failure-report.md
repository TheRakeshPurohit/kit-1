# Windows CI Test Failure Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The Windows CI tests are failing during the `pnpm test` step in the GitHub Actions workflow. After applying the initial fixes (missing imports, syntax errors, etc.), Windows tests continue to fail while macOS and Ubuntu tests pass successfully.

## Current CI Status
- **macOS**: ✅ Passing
- **Ubuntu**: ✅ Passing  
- **Windows**: ❌ Failing at `pnpm test` step

## Identified Issues

### 1. Missing `fork` Import in test-sdk/main.test.js
**Issue**: The test file uses `fork` from child_process but doesn't import it directly.
- Line 23: `let mockApp = fork(KIT_APP_PROMPT, {`
- The function is expected to be available as a global from the kit SDK

**Root Cause**: The globals are imported in `test-sdk/config.js` but may not be properly initialized on Windows before the tests run.

### 2. Path Resolution Issues
Windows uses different path separators and drive letters which can cause issues:
- `test-sdk/config.js` uses forward slashes in path construction
- `scripts/test-pre.js` mixes path styles
- The sourcemap formatter tests were recently updated to handle Windows paths but may still have edge cases

### 3. Test Environment Setup
The test setup process involves:
1. Building the kit SDK to `./.kit`
2. Setting environment variables (KIT, KENV, PATH)
3. Importing globals from the built SDK
4. Running tests that depend on these globals

On Windows, this chain may break due to:
- Path separator differences
- Environment variable handling
- Module resolution differences

### 4. Process Management
Several tests spawn child processes (`fork`, `exec`) which behave differently on Windows:
- Process cleanup may not work correctly
- Signal handling differs
- File locks can prevent cleanup

## Affected Files

### Core Test Infrastructure
- `test-sdk/main.test.js` - Main test file with missing imports
- `test-sdk/config.js` - Test setup and global imports
- `scripts/test-pre.js` - Pre-test setup script
- `test/ava.config.mjs` - AVA test runner configuration

### Platform-Specific Code
- `src/platform/win32.js` - Windows-specific implementations
- `src/platform/base.js` - Base platform implementations
- `src/core/utils.ts` - Contains path handling utilities

### CI Configuration
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add explicit imports in test-sdk/main.test.js**:
   ```javascript
   import { fork } from 'node:child_process'
   ```

2. **Ensure globals are properly loaded**:
   - Add verification that globals are available before tests run
   - Consider adding a delay or retry mechanism for Windows

3. **Fix path handling**:
   - Use `path.join()` consistently instead of string concatenation
   - Normalize paths before comparisons
   - Handle Windows drive letters properly

### Medium-term Actions
1. **Improve test isolation**:
   - Each test should be self-contained
   - Reduce dependency on global state
   - Add proper cleanup in afterEach hooks

2. **Add Windows-specific test configurations**:
   - Longer timeouts for process operations
   - Different path expectations
   - Platform-specific test skips where appropriate

3. **Enhanced CI debugging**:
   - Add verbose logging for Windows runs
   - Capture and analyze failed test output
   - Add test retries for flaky tests

## Test Failure Patterns
Recent CI runs show consistent Windows failures:
- Run #17086076650: Windows test failed (current)
- Run #17085144194: Windows CI test failures
- Run #17084465464: Windows path separator issues
- Run #17079282330: Sourcemap formatter cross-platform paths
- Run #17078618660: Child process cleanup issues

All failures occur in the Windows environment during the test phase, suggesting systematic platform-specific issues rather than random failures.

## Bundle Information
A repomix bundle has been created at `windows-ci-failure-bundle.md` containing:
- 13 files (31,039 tokens)
- All relevant test, configuration, and platform-specific files
- Complete context for debugging the Windows CI failures

## Next Steps
1. Apply the immediate fixes to unblock CI
2. Run tests locally on a Windows machine if possible
3. Add comprehensive logging to identify exact failure points
4. Consider setting up a Windows development environment for testing
5. Implement platform-specific test configurations

## Conclusion
The Windows CI failures stem from a combination of missing imports, path handling differences, and global dependency issues. The fixes identified above should resolve the immediate blockers, but a more comprehensive review of Windows compatibility throughout the test suite is recommended for long-term stability.
