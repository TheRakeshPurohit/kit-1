# Kit Development Guide

This guide provides instructions for building, testing, and working with the Kit codebase.

## Testing

Tests are written using `ava` and follow the `*.test.ts` naming convention.

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  pnpm ava
  ```

- **Run a single test file:**
  ```bash
  pnpm ava src/core/env-safety.test.ts
  ```
  *(replace `src/core/env-safety.test.ts` with the path to the test file)*

## Building

Building can be disruptive. Please ask a team member before running a full build if they are running a dev build.

- **Run a full build:**
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

## Avoid `pnpm test`

The `pnpm test` command is an "integration" test for the SDK and requires a full build. Avoid using it unless you specifically intend to run these integration tests.
