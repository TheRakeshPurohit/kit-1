## Follow patterns ".test.ts" and "ava" for writing tests.

## Run all the tests
`pnpm ava`

## Run a single test, e.g., src/core/env-safety.test.ts
`pnpm ava src/core/env-safety.test.ts`

## Build. Ask first! Building is disruptive as I'm often running the dev build.
`pnpm build`

## Avoid `pnpm test`. It's an "integration" test for the SDK. Ask first! Building is disruptive as I'm often running the dev build.
`pnpm test` requires a build and full test
