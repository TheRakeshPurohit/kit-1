## INTRODUCTION

This document serves as the central repository for all project rules, coding standards, workflow guidelines, references, documentation structures, and best practices for the AI coding assistant. It is a "living" document, evolving with each new user-AI interaction.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   All project-related documentation is stored in markdown format.
*   Filenames should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
*   Each document should have a clear title and introduction.
*   Use SpecStory to automatically generate markdown files from user-AI interactions.

## TECH STACK

*   (Add specific technologies, libraries, and frameworks used in the project here)

## CODING STANDARDS

*   (Define coding style, naming conventions, and best practices for each language used in the project)

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

*   (Define the project's workflow, including branching strategies, code review processes, and release procedures)

## TESTING

*   When running the "testing-mcp" tool, it requires an argument. Provide a value for the argument to execute the tool. Example: "awesome". If the tool is not found, request clarification from the user as to its location and usage.

## DEBUGGING

*   (Define debugging strategies and tools)

## ERROR HANDLING

*   (Define how errors should be handled and logged)

## SECURITY

*   (Define security best practices and guidelines)

## REFERENCES
